				My group and I made a map and character displayer for Dungeons ‘n Dragons. 
				We acomplished this using JFrames and buffered images in Java and created a "fog of war" mechanic that, if turned on, covered the map and as the character model on the screen moved around, by clicking and holding the mouse, the map would uncover itself.
				<br>
				What I learned:
				<ul>
					<li>How java handles images and layering images on each other</li>
					<li>Scaling projects to the time-line available</li>
					<li>Partitioning large projects into smaller, easier projects that are easier to focus on and work on</li>
				</ul>
