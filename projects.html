				Squirrel Hacks XI (HackISU 2019) - Hot Car Ally
			</div>
			<br>
			<p class="section-content">
				My team and I made a system to alert parents if they left their child in a hot car. 
				<br>
				Using an Arduino Uno, temperature, GPS, ultrasonic sensors, buttons, and radio transceivers, we were able to
				1) Tell if there was a child in a car seat,
				2) Know the temperature of the car,
				3) Get the location of the car seat,
				and 4) Communicate with an external "key fob" made of another Arduino Uno, buzzer, and radio transceiver. 
				<br>
				Using all that, if the car seat and "key fob" lost communication with each other, the "key fob" would buzz if the last known location of the child was in the car seat, 
				and the car seat would send data (temperature, GPS location, and status of the child) over serial to a Raspberry Pi, which would then parse the data and send that to a web server to display that data on an app on the parent's phone.
				The web server would also send text notifications to the parent that something was left in their car seat, with a time limit to get back before the car got too hot. If the parent's location was too far away for them to get back, the car seat (using its location data) would notify authorities to get the child out of the car.

				3rd year: ComS 309 Semester project - 007: Knockout
			</div>

			<p class="section-content">
				In this project, my team and I created an augmented-reality Android app based off of the game <a title="Assassin wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin_(game)" target="_blank">Assassin</a>.
				<br>
				I focused on the backend functions and API that delt with HTTP requests. Using the Spring framework, I created an API to get and create players, game sessions, items, and handle game logic. 
				This included assigning players to a game session desired using a pass code, communication with a frontend through Tokens instead of sensitive user and game information, distance calculation between two latitude and longitude points, and item inventory for players (including keeping track of items that persist over game sessions, and the buffs that items give to certain statistics of a player)
				<br>

				3rd year: CprE 288 Final project - Roomba<span>&#174;</span> Rover
			</div>
			<br>
			<p class="section-content">
				The final project for this class was to program a Roomba with a custom embedded chip to navigate an obstacle course by user input. My team and I had to figure out a way to get information from the ultrasonic and infrared, bump, and cliff sensors on the Roomba to display on a console on our control computer wirelessly, and display in a way that was easily digestible for us to determine our next move.
				<br>
				In order to display information, we decided to, using PuTTY and circle equations, print a top-down view of what was in front of the Roomba. The Roomba would figure out where obstacles were, and their circumference, and then it would send back a 2D array to project on our console. Movement was handled by mapping DS4 controller inputs to keyboard presses and was sent to the robot through PuTTY to move forward 10cm, backward 10cm, or turn right or left 10 degrees. After the goal of the obstacle course was found, we would then drive in it and play a victory song.

				2nd year: CprE 281 Final project - FPGA Traffic Light
			</div>
			<br>
			<p class="section-content">
				This goal of this final project was to create a traffic control system for a 4-way intersection using the FPGA we've been using in lab. This involved keeping track of the number of cars in each lane, counting up the cars in a user-chosen lane to the user-defined max capacity of that lane, and automatically removing cars from each lane until either the lane has reached zero cars, or the lane has decreased by 5 cars.
				<br>
				I decided to use 4 of the number displays in conjunction with a register file to keep track of the number of cars in each lane. Each lane also had its own counter that could count up to 15, or a user-defined maximum. To decrement the cars in a lane, I used the FPGA's internal clock and slowed it down using T flip-flops to about 1 clock cycle every 2 seconds.

				We accomplished this using JFrames and buffered images in Java and created a "fog of war" mechanic that, if turned on, covered the map and as the character model on the screen moved around, by clicking and holding the mouse, the map would uncover itself.
